# Day_19_Turtle_race_game
a turtle race game using Python's Turtle module. The game allows users to bet on which turtle, out of six different colors, will win a race. The turtles move forward randomly, making the outcome unpredictable. If the player's chosen turtle wins, they receive a congratulatory message; otherwise, they are informed of the actual winner.
